Problem Solving with JavaScript (Cracking the Coding Interview)

Welcome to my repository where I share my solutions to various coding problems from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" using JavaScript.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you understand the structure of the repository and how to use the code.

Prerequisites
A basic understanding of JavaScript is required to understand the solutions.
It is recommended to have a copy of the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" to follow along with the problem statements.

Directory Structure
Each problem is contained in its own folder with the problem statement and my solution.
The problem statement is taken from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" and is included in the folder.
The solution is provided in a file and can be run using Node.js.

How to use
Clone or download the repository.
Navigate to the problem folder you are interested in.
Open the solution file to see my implementation.
You can run the solution by executing node solution.js in the command line.

Contributing
If you have any suggestions or improvements to the solutions, please feel free to create a pull request.
